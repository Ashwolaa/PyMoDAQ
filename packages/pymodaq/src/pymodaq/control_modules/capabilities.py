"""Hardware capability declarations for PyMoDAQ plugins, written in the pymeasure style.

A device declares its quantities as class attributes::

    class SpectrometerCamera:
        spectrum = measurement(units='counts', shape=(1024,))
        temperature = measurement(units='K')
        exposure = control(units='ms', lo=1, hi=1000, epsilon=0.1)
        trigger = control(values=['internal', 'external'])

The attribute name is the quantity's name, which is the channel name used by
``read`` and ``write``.

Two independent properties describe a quantity:

- **access**: :attr:`Access.MEASUREMENT` (read only) or :attr:`Access.CONTROL` (read and write).
- **domain**: :attr:`Domain.CONTINUOUS` (a range, with optional limits and move tolerance) or
  :attr:`Domain.DISCRETE` (a finite list of ``values``).

Either access can have either domain: a discrete measurement is a status readback.

    """A quantity's one declared action: a callback, and how its button looks.

    ``icon`` is passed straight through to the GUI's own icon resolution
    (:func:`pymodaq_gui.utils.styling.create_icon`), so anything it accepts works here too: a Material
    icon name, a path to a png, a registered icon, a Qt theme icon, or a standard pixmap name. Left
    blank, the button shows text only. ``label`` defaults to the action's name, title-cased.

    ``opts`` reaches ``add_action`` directly for anything ``icon``/``label``/``checkable`` don't cover
    (e.g. ``icon_color``, ``icon_checked``, ``rotate``), without this class needing a field for every
    one of its keyword arguments.

    ``checkable=True`` makes the button stay pressed between clicks (e.g. a hardware dark-reference
    toggle, on until clicked again) instead of firing once (e.g. a one-shot calibration). The callback
    then takes the button's new checked state as a second argument, ``callback(plugin, checked)``,
    instead of just ``callback(plugin)`` - the plugin is never left to infer which way a checkable
    action just flipped.

    ``button=False`` registers the action (still callable through ``run_action``, scripting, or
    another trigger such as a ``merge_into`` row) without building a toolbar button for it - for an
    action you don't want cluttering a row but still want reachable. This is the action's own knob for
    that, separate from ``ui_add``/``ui_remove``: those only ever suppress or add a widget the
    declaration would otherwise get for free (see :func:`toolbar_widgets`), and an action is never one
    of those - you only get it by declaring it, so "declared but buttonless" belongs here, not there.

    shared mechanism wearing three hats:

    - The **representation** - how this quantity's value is shown/edited (``value``, ``selector``,
      ``toggle``, ``label``, ``read``/``snap``) - is exactly one widget, chosen for you from
      ``(access, domain)``. ``widget=`` (see :func:`control`) substitutes a supported alternative for
      it outright; there is nothing to add or remove, since there is only ever one at a time.
    - **Companion views** - ``slider``, ``show_graph``, ``save``, ``history``, ``show_controls`` - are
      additive and synced to the same value, never a replacement for the representation above.
      ``ui_add``/``ui_remove`` are for exactly this: suppressing or adding one of these, never a
      representation and never an action (see below) - a widget this declaration would otherwise get,
      or not get, for free.
    - **Actions** (``actions``/``stop``) aren't a representation of a value at all - they're
      device-specific commands (e.g. a motor axis's stop, or a spectrum's background capture), so they
      never default: a button only appears once the quantity declares one, and a measurement can
      declare one just as a control can - nothing about firing a callback requires a value to write.
      Whether a *declared* action gets a button is the action's own ``button=`` (see :class:`Action`),
      not ``ui_remove`` - you only have the action because you asked for it, so "declared but
      buttonless" belongs where it's declared, not in the same knob that suppresses a free default.

    ``lo``, ``hi`` and ``epsilon`` describe a continuous range (``epsilon`` is the move tolerance).
    ``values`` describes a discrete set instead.

    ``widget`` substitutes the one alternative representation for the default a two-valued discrete
    control otherwise gets: ``'toggle'`` in place of the usual dropdown ``selector``, for a control
    whose two values read better as on/off than as a labelled list (e.g. ``values=['disabled',
    'enabled']``). It replaces the default outright, rather than adding alongside it - unlike
    ``ui_add``/``ui_remove`` below, which are for additive companion widgets, never the representation
    itself.

    ``get`` and ``set`` answer a read or a write of this quantity directly: ``get(plugin)`` returns the
    value, ``set(plugin, value)`` applies it, instead of ``read``/``write``. See :func:`measurement` for
    how ``get`` interacts with periodic batching. ``set`` and ``setting`` cannot both be given.

    ``readback`` declares the measurement that reports the actual value, which the GUI shows in the same row.
    ``True`` names it ``<name>_readback``; a string names it. If a measurement of that name is already
    declared, it is used; otherwise it is created with the units, shape and values of the control.

    ``setting`` declares that writing this control goes through the plugin's own settings (``params``)
    instead of ``write``: the device thread sets the named parameter and calls ``commit_settings``.
    ``True`` uses the control's own name; a string names a differently-named parameter. The parameter
    itself must already be declared in ``params``; this is checked when the device opens, not here.

    ``actions`` adds a button per entry, named after its key, calling ``callback(plugin)``: opt-in,
    for the controls that need one (e.g. a motor axis) - the same kwarg exists on :func:`measurement`
    too, for an action with nothing to write (e.g. a spectrum's background capture). A value can be a
    bare callback (label: the key, title-cased), or an :class:`Action` for an icon, a different label,
    ``checkable=True`` (the callback then also takes the button's new state,
    ``callback(plugin, checked)``), and/or ``button=False`` to register the action without a toolbar
    button for it. ``stop=`` is shorthand for a conventionally-iconed ``'stop'`` entry in ``actions``;
    both may be given together. With ``readback`` and ``epsilon`` set, a write's pending state also
    waits for the readback to settle, so ``stop`` has something meaningful to interrupt - see
    ``device_module_connections.md`` ("Writing and settling", "Actions") for the full
    action/settle/LED interaction and why only ``stop`` clears a pending row.

    ``merge_into`` folds this control into another quantity's own row (a control's or a measurement's)
    as a checkable action, instead of giving it a row of its own - e.g. an axis's enable button next to
    its move controls. Needs exactly two ``values``, the same requirement as ``widget='toggle'`` above;
    still dispatches through the normal write path, only where it is drawn changes. See
    ``device_module_connections.md`` ("merge_into") for the rendering details.
