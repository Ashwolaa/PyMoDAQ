By construction, `spread` data have navigation axes, the coordinates of the points (note that the scalar *points* in our example could also be `Data1D` or `Data2D` *points*, we'll see that with the `ViewerND`) and specifying the distribution to `spread` allows PyMoDAQ to handle this properly compared to the `uniform` case. But then, the parameter `nav_indexes` is used to specify which dimension of the data array will be considered navigation, the rest beeing signal. However in our collection, the shape of the data is only `(100,)` so `nav_indexes` is `(0, )`. But still, we do have two axes: the X and Y coordinates of our points... To handle this, the Axis object have to include a new parameter, the `spread_order` specifying which axis corresponds to which coordinate but both refering to the same `navigation` dimension of the data.

    "Here you now see the image of the brain (signal part) at a certain height (12.17, navigation part) within the skull. The signal data is taken at the height corresponding to the crosshair vertical line within the navigation panel. Moving it laterally will display a different brain z-cut. The navigation 1D plot is calculated from the white ROI on the signal panel, applying the mathematical function to it (here *mean* see on top of the plot) and displaying this for all z-cut on the navigation panel. Therefore, moving this ROI will change the printed navigation plot. Another widget (on the left) displays information on the data: its shape and navigation/signal dimensions. From this one can also change which axes are navigation (here this is axis 2 as specified when the data object has been constructed). In the notebook, you can change this selecting one, two or even the three indexes and see how it's impacting on the `ViewerND`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal data dimension cannot exeed 2, meaning you can only plot signal that are `Data0D`, `Data1D` or `Data2D` which make sense as only this kind of data are produced by usual detectors. On the navigation side however, on can have as many navigation axes as needed. Below you'll see some possibilities.\n",
